## üîë OpenAI API Key Setup

### Step 1: Get an OpenAI API Key

1. **Visit OpenAI**: Go to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

1. **Open the .env file** in your project root:
   ```bash
   # If the file doesn't exist, create it
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your API key**:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Save the file** and restart your server

### Step 3: Verify Setup

1. **Restart the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the application** - you should now see "AI content generated successfully!" instead of the model access error

   ```

2. **Verify API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

   - Ensure you have sufficient credits

3. **Check Account Status**:
   - Verify your OpenAI account is active
   - Check if you have any billing issues
   - Ensure you're not rate-limited

4. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure the .env file is in the root directory
   ls -la .env
   
   # Check if the variable is loaded
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Invalid API key"
**Solution**: 
- Double-check the API key format (should start with `sk-`)
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Regenerate the API key if needed

#### Issue: "Insufficient credits"
**Solution**:
- Add payment method to your OpenAI account
- The free $5 credit should be sufficient for testing

#### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**:
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Check your usage in the OpenAI dashboard

## üöÄ Quick Start (Demo Mode)

If you want to try the application immediately without setting up an API key:

   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   
   **Note:** The React app runs on port 3000 and proxies API requests to the backend on port 3001.
